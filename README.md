# Sorting-Algorithm-Visualization
This project is a web-based visualization tool for comparing the performance and behavior of five different sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Selection Sort. Users can generate random arrays and watch as each sorting algorithm sorts the array in real-time, side by side.
